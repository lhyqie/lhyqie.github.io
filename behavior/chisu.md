### Product features
How to balance customer asks and organic feature growth?
- Really take the time and have conversations with the customer about what they really want to accomplish, and then we can think about user stories.
* In this conversation, propose something, make sure you make them feel you're solving problems for them
* You can also sit down with your lead engineer, customer success person, to go through backlog and feature requests from customers.

Features can be
* Derivatives of your core platform vs specific technology integration
* Build with a generic approach. Make sure the work of your component is on your part and the work of integration is on their part. 
* API first perspective is very useful. Github and Launchdarkly build the API first and then the UI.
 * Good for validating the solution without building it.
 * You have a reference point to talk to the customers.
 * Force the engineer to think from the customer's perspective.
* A few things to think about in API design
 * User agnostic
 * one-off requests vs batch
 * Scale
 * Add/Delete as well as update/modify
 * API update/deprecation strategy
 * Github, twilio, launchdarkly are good examples

### Career
IC or manager
* Ultimately what problems are you mostly enjoying solving?
* IC: Hard engineering problems
* Manager: How to enable the success of others.
 * Better off disconnecting from the details. Not solving the problem for IC, but how can I enable you to better solve it? Like how can I help you get more time - should I offload some of the responsibilities from you? Do you need more resources?
 * Help the people. But don't take over. Find ways to tell them the direction, without telling the answer. Enable the success of others and also recognize and appreciate the success of others.

Management as we move up to sr mgr, director, vp level
* At startups
 * more time on planning and strategy, instead of spending time on specific features/design
 * Problems to be focused have a longer time horizon
  * What do we need to do in 2 years, 3 years?
 * Think from a resource perspective
 * Less about how we build this feature, much more about looking at the market/ecosystem opportunity, how customers would use this, what to build next, etc
* At large compannies
 * a lot of time coaching
 * hiring is a priority
  * hire managers that are able to hire good engineers
  * Top of mind. You keep track of it. Prioritize above all else. But not necessarily spend the most time on it.
