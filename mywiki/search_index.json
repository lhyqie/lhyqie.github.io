(epitaphs/hallw)\n“I am told there are people who do not care for maps, and I find it hard to\nbelieve.” ~ Robert Louis Stevenson\nMaps are very common data structures, but how should we choose which of the many\navailable map types to use in a given situation? This tip aims to give a clear\nanswer for most cases.\nabsl::flat_hash_map is a good choice of map for most situations, and should be\nconsidered the default option. There are situations where another choice is\nneeded or preferred; using a choice other than absl::flat_hash_map generally\nwarrants a comment to tell maintainers why the choice was made. Factors that\nmight lead to a different choice include needs for pointer stability, sorted\nordering, or a stable iteration order, as well as whether the map is written\njust once or updated over time.\nLet's define our terms and give a decision tree.\nDefinitions\nPointer stability: a map is said to have pointer stability (equivalently,\n\"reference stability\") if a pointer (or reference) to a key or value in a map is\nguaranteed to remain valid for the lifetime of the map. 1\nStable iteration order: a map is said to have stable iteration order if the\norder of its elements is consistent across different instances of a container\nand different runs of the same binary. 2\nOrder of Preferences\n\nPrefer a hashed container unless sorted order is needed. go/hashmaps is\nauthoritative in this case. In brief:\nUse absl::flat_hash_map unless there is a reason why it doesn't work\nwell in your situation.\nIs pointer-stability of values (but not keys) needed?\nUse absl::flat_hash_map>.\n\n\nIs pointer-stability of keys needed?\nUse absl::node_hash_map, which provides pointer-stability for both\nkeys and values.\n\n\nIs stable iteration order required?\nUse gtl::linked_hash_map.\n\n\nAre all of the values compile-time constants, and can the container's\ntype be deduced instead of being spelled out?\nConsider using gtl::fixed_flat_map_of (see\nTip of the Week #170: constexpr associative containers).\n\n\n\n\nIf sorted order is required, consider an ordered container:\nUse absl::btree_map unless there is a reason why it doesn't work well\nin your situation.\nIs the map written once and then read many times? A \"flat\" map (backed\nby a contiguous array) can provide better performance and use less\nmemory.\nAre runtime values required?\nUse gtl::flat_map.\n\n\nDoes the code need to spell out the type?\nUse gtl::flat_map.\n\n\nWould compile-time (constexpr) initialization be too costly?\nUse gtl::flat_map.\n\n\nAre all of the values compile-time constants, and can the\ncontainer's type be deduced instead of being spelled out?\nConsider using gtl::fixed_flat_map_of (see\nTip of the Week #170: constexpr associative containers).\n\n\n\n\nIs the map written more than once?\nIs pointer-stability of values (but not keys) needed?\nUse absl::btree_map>.\n\n\nIs pointer-stability of keys needed?\nUse std::map, which provides\npointer-stability for both keys and values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe astute reader (hello, astute reader) may have noticed that\nstd::unordered_map is not mentioned above, and neither is the pre-standard\nhash_map. New code should never use hash_map, and should use\nstd::unordered_map only if it is unable to use Abseil's more optimized\nalternatives.\nNOTE: These recommendations also apply, mutatis mutandis, for sets.\nParting Thoughts\n\nI usually make this point: even when the choice is not about runtime\nefficiency, it's documenting your intention for the future maintainer. \"I need\nthese unique and sorted\" and \"I need these unique\" are two different\nstatements -- please take a moment, and make the right one. - aemelianov@\n\nHistorically, ordered containers were sometimes used to make life easier when\nwriting code. Now that absl::Hash is available,\nproviding high-quality hashing for your types is straightforward, allowing us to\nimprove performance and maintainability by preferring hashed containers. Just as\nstd::vector should be the default option for sequences, so\nabsl::flat_hash_map (and absl::flat_hash_set) should now be used for most\nassociative containers.\nWhile it aims to cover most situations, the decision tree given in this tip does\nnot describe every situation. If measurements show that a different container\nwould work better in your application then go ahead and use it, leaving a\ncomment to document the choice for future readers.\nReferences\n\ngo/hashmaps\ngo/swisstable\nlinks to go/hash-iteration-randomization\n\n\ngo/absl-hash\nhttp://lafstern.org/matt/col1.pdf\n\n\n1.
